Profiles allow you to set specific input mappings on a per game basis when a matching executable is found. Default Profile is used when no match is found.

## Profile Settings

### Disable Lizard Mode
Lizard mode allows the Steam Deck Controller to fall back to its lizard brain (mouse and keyboard emulation). When this mode is not marked as disabled the right trackpad is used for mouse movement, the right trigger is the left mouse button, and the dpad emulates the up, down, left, and right arrow keys of the keyboard. Place a checkmark in the box to disable Lizard Mode (disabling can prevent double input in games that use the dpad).

Axis mappings allow you to assign control to any Steam Deck hardware button with an axis to any Xbox controller axis button.
